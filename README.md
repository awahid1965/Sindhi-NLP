 I am working on Sindhi NLP. In this concern, I have developed computational linguistics tools like Sindhi online Parser (using UPOS and SPOS), Sindhi Stemmer, Sindhi lemmatizer, Sindhi corpus builder, Sindhi sentiment analysis and Sindhi WordNet. These tools are available on www.sindhinlp.com
These tools are only for purpose of research on right hand written languages especially Sindhi language.
